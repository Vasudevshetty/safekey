## üöÄ Getting Started with Phase 3

### Week 1: Cloud Sync Foundation

1. **Day 1-2**: Design cloud provider interface
2. **Day 3-4**: Implement GitHub Gists provider
3. **Day 5-7**: Basic sync commands and TUI integration

### Week 2: Advanced Search & Bulk Operations

1. **Day 1-3**: Implement fuzzy search functionality
2. **Day 4-5**: Add bulk selection and operations
3. **Day 6-7**: Enhanced keybindings and navigation

### Next Steps

Ready to start implementing Phase 3.1! The foundation is solid, tests are passing, and the architecture is ready for cloud sync integration.

**Current Priority**: Begin with cloud provider abstraction and GitHub Gists integration as the simplest cloud storage option.
